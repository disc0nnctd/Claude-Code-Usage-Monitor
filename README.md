# Claude Code Usage Monitor

A lightweight Windows taskbar widget that displays your Claude API rate limit usage in real time.

## What it does

Embeds directly into the Windows taskbar and shows two progress bars:

- **5h** — Session usage (5-hour rolling window)
- **7d** — Weekly usage (7-day rolling window)

Each bar shows the current utilization percentage and a countdown until the rate limit resets.

## How it works

1. Reads your Claude OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
2. Sends a minimal API request to the Anthropic Messages API
3. Parses rate limit headers (`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*`) from the response
4. Renders the widget using Win32 GDI, embedded as a child window of the taskbar
5. Polls every 15 minutes by default (adjustable via context menu) and updates countdown timers between polls

The widget automatically detects dark/light mode from Windows system settings. You can drag the left divider to reposition the widget along the taskbar. Settings (position and poll frequency) are persisted to `%APPDATA%\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor\settings.json`.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (MSVC target)
- An active Claude Pro/Team subscription with OAuth credentials stored by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/claude-code-usage-monitor.exe`.

## Usage

Run the executable — the widget appears in your taskbar.

- **Drag** the left divider to reposition the widget along the taskbar
- **Right-click** for a context menu with **Refresh**, **Update Frequency**, **Settings** (Start with Windows, Reset Position), and **Exit**
