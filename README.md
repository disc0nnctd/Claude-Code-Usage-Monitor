# Claude Code + Codex Usage Monitor

A lightweight Windows taskbar widget for people using Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, or both.

It sits in your taskbar and shows how much of your Claude Code or Codex usage window you have left, without needing to open the terminal or the provider site.

## What You Get

- Claude Code tracking with **5h** and **7d** usage bars
- Codex tracking with **5h** and **7d** usage bars
- A live countdown until the active provider resets
- Left-click to switch between Claude and Codex
- Right-click provider summaries including Codex plan, code review, recent prompt/session counts, and last prompt preview
- A small native widget that lives directly in the Windows taskbar
- Right-click options for refresh, update frequency, language, startup, and updates

## Who This Is For

This app is for Windows users who already have **Claude Code**, **Codex**, or both installed and signed in.

It works best if you want a simple "how close am I to the limit?" display that is always visible, plus a quick menu to inspect recent Codex activity.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Claude Code (CLI or App) installed and authenticated for Claude tracking
- Codex CLI installed and authenticated for Codex tracking

If you use Claude Code through WSL, that is supported too. The monitor can read your Claude Code credentials from Windows or from your WSL environment.
Codex usage is read from your local `%USERPROFILE%\.codex` data on Windows.

## Install

For now, download the latest `claude-code-usage-monitor.exe` from the [Releases](../../releases) page and run it.

WinGet support is on the way and currently waiting on final approval. When that is live, installation will be a one-liner.

Planned command:

```powershell
winget install CodeZeno.ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor
```

## Use

Run the app and it will appear in your taskbar.

- Drag the left divider to move it
- Left-click anywhere except the divider to switch the active provider
- Right-click for refresh, provider selection, update frequency, provider summaries, start with Windows, reset position, language, updates, and exit

Settings are saved to:

```text
%APPDATA%\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor\settings.json
```

To build from source:

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

## Account Support

This app works with the same account types that Claude Code itself supports.

As of **March 19, 2026**, Anthropic's Claude Code setup documentation says:

- **Supported:** Pro, Max, Teams, Enterprise, and Console accounts
- **Not supported:** the free Claude.ai plan

If Anthropic changes Claude Code availability in the future, this app should follow whatever Claude Code supports, as long as the usage data remains exposed through the same authenticated endpoints.

## Privacy And Security

This project is **open source**, so you can inspect exactly what it does.

What the app reads:

- Your local Claude Code OAuth credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
- If needed, the same credentials file inside an installed WSL distro
- Your local Codex auth file from `~/.codex/auth.json`
- Your local Codex prompt history from `~/.codex/history.jsonl` for recent-activity summaries

What the app sends over the network:

- Requests to Anthropic's Claude endpoints to read your usage and rate-limit information
- Requests to OpenAI's Codex usage endpoint to read your Codex limits
- If needed, a local `codex app-server` probe to read Codex rate limits from the installed CLI
- Requests to GitHub only if you use the app's update check / self-update feature

What the app stores locally:

- Widget position
- Polling frequency
- Language preference

What it does **not** do:

- It does not send your credentials to any other server
- It does not use a separate backend service
- It does not collect analytics or telemetry
- It does not upload your project files

Notes:

- If your Claude Code token is expired, the app may ask the local Claude CLI to refresh it in the background
- Portable installs can update themselves by downloading the latest release from this repository

## How It Works

The monitor:

1. Finds your Claude Code login credentials
2. Finds your Codex login state and recent local history
3. Reads your current usage from Anthropic and OpenAI
4. Falls back to the local Codex CLI rate-limit RPC if the Codex web usage endpoint is unavailable
5. Shows the active provider directly in the Windows taskbar
6. Refreshes periodically in the background

If the newer usage endpoint is unavailable, it can fall back to reading the rate-limit headers returned by Claude's Messages API.
